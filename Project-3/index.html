         <p>In other words, high volume noises are abnormal. As the world is advancing at a rapid rate, so is noise pollution. Technology has made things easier for people by creating appliances and devices for almost everything. You want to mix or grind something? It can be done with a mixer and blender. You are feeling hot? Simply turn on the AC or cooler. Do you want entertainment at home? You can watch television or play music. However, people donâ€™t realize this comfort comes with harmful effects too. All the mentioned appliances contribute to noise pollution. They disturb the natural rhythm of life and fall in the category of a pollutant.</p>

         <div id="Beef">
          <h2>Beef</h2>
          <p>Not only humans but noise pollution also impacts wildlife too. For instance, pets become aggressive or afraid when they hear a loud noise. It is one of the main reasons why crackers are not encouraged when pets are around.
    In short, we must make people aware of the impact of noise pollution. Likewise, we must encourage them to adopt ways that do not contribute to noise pollution. If everyone starts doing the same on an individual level, we will surely be able to reduce noise pollution to a great extent.</p>

          <p>Similarly, the ever-increasing use of automobiles is a major cause of this pollution. Not only automobiles but other transport vehicles like airplanes, buses, bikes, trucks and more also are a part of it. People honk unnecessarily in the traffic and listen to loud music on the way which creates high levels of noise.
    
    Furthermore, social events like marriages, parties, and religious functions in places like clubs, pubs, temples, halls and more create a lot of nuisance in the residential areas. In addition, the construction activities like mining, the building of flyovers, bridges and more also produce great noise.</p>
